# Steps

1. Scaffolded out redux
  * created an empty combineReducer
  * created a store
  * we used Provider in index.js
2. Create presentational components (how it looks)
3. created a useful reducer and added it to combineReducer (what data?)
4. created action-creators and added those events to our reducer (how does it change)
5. created a selector to get relevant data (what specific data does my component need)
6. container (tie it together)
